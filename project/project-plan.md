# Project Plan

## Title
"Berlin Building Atlas and Parking Space Management Integration Project"

## Main Question
How can data from the Berlin Building Atlas be leveraged to optimize and enhance parking space management in Berlin, improving accessibility and urban planning?

## Description
Analyzing the integration of Berlin Building Atlas data with parking space management is vital for addressing urban accessibility and development challenges. This project seeks to optimize parking solutions using innovative methods. It aims to unravel how building data can enhance parking management in Berlin, offering insights into more efficient urban planning, reduced congestion, and improved accessibility, ultimately benefiting residents and the city's sustainable growth.

## Datasources
### Datasource1: Berlin Building Atlas
